\usage{
burstiness(ts, min_iet = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{character vector}

\item{min_iet}{minimum interevent sequence spacing}
}
\description{
burstiness() estimates the burstiness coefficient for each of the unique
codes in a time series.
}
\details{
burstiness() returns a named vector with an estimated burstiness coefficient
for each unique code in the data sequence, including blank or missing codes.

Standard errors for the resulting burstiness coefficients can be
obtained via boot::tsboot(ts, statistic = burstiness, R = 100, sim =
"fixed", l = length(ts)/2) or the like.

See time_burstiness() to estimate the burstiness a vector containing the
times at which an event occurs.

There is a known problem with a non-NULL minimum inter-event time. That
needs to be corrected.
