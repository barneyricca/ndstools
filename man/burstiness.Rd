\title{burstiness}
\usage{
burstiness(ts, min_iet = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{character vector (representing consecutive entries in a time-
series)}

\item{min_iet}{minimum interevent sequence spacing}
}
\description{
burstiness() estimates the burstiness coefficient for each of the unique
codes in a time series.
}
\details{
burstiness() returns a named vector with an estimated burstiness coefficient
for each unique code in the data sequence, including blank or missing codes.
It is assumed that the data come from a time-series and that each data were
recorded at a constant sampling frequency (or, in the case of event-based
sequences, can be treated as having been recorded at a constant sampling
frequency).

Standard errors for the resulting burstiness coefficients can be
obtained via boot::tsboot(ts, statistic = burstiness, R = 100, sim =
"fixed", l = length(ts)/2) or the like.

There is a known problem with a non-NULL minimum inter-event time. That
needs to be corrected.
