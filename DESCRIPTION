Description: This package contains a number of tools for nonlinear time series
    (NLTS) analyses. Some of these tools are available elsewhere, but were
    ported to Rcpp here for speed. Some of these tools are modifications and
    encapsulations of code that can be found in Huffaker, Bitelli, and Rosa 
    (2017). Some of these tools are new.
