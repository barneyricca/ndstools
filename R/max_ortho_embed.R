#' @description This function computes the delay state space embedding of a
#' time series, based on the method proposed by Pecora et al. (2008).
#'
#' @details
#' max_ortho_embed returns a (possibly non-constant) delay state space
#' embedding of ts. It does this by determining the maximally independent
#' delay vector at each step. The maximum embedding dimenions for the naive
#' approach (the only one implemented so far) is 6. Eventually, this will
#' include 3 methods; the mutual information method implemented here, the
#' method proposed by Pecora et al., and an approximation of the Pecora method.
#' The naive approach (method = "mutual") is a slight extension of the constant
#' delay embedding approach.

  # The first dimension is ts1 and tau_lag = 0
  # To find the second dimension:
  # - For each subsequent possible time lag (tau_1...tau_max)
  #   - For each of a sample of points from the time series. (For short enough
  #     series, use all points?)
  #     - Pick a neighborhood of K points (ball of delta_prime radius) about
  #       ts[i].
  #     - Find the smallest epsilon with L points mapped from K, set such that
  #       L/K just fails the significance test. Set this to epsilon_try.
  #     - Reduce K by 1 and repeat the previous step, reducing epsilon_try if
  #       possible.
  #     - if epsilon_try cannot be reduced, epsilon_try -> epsilon_star
  #     - Go to the next sampled point from the time series
  #   - Compute the mean epsilon_star for that lag
  # - Go to the next time lag
  # - Find the maximum mean epsilon_star across the lags to identify tau_add
  # - Now, is it possible to add ts(t + tau_lag) independently to the existing
  #   dimension, or must we stop here? The way we do that is:
